    "I am a beginning python student in an intro course that is learning coding for the first time. I want you to create a practice problem for me on basic object-oriented programming, such as creating objects with instance variables and simple methods. So far, I've learned how to create variables, getting inputs, some popular built- in functions, if statements, some basic for and while loops, lists, dictionaries, writing custom functions, and exception handling. The problem you make doesn't have to use all those things (in fact, I'd prefer that it doesn't just so it isn't too hard), I just want to give you context on where in the course I'm at. I want you to give me a problem so I can practice OOP. Give me the problem, but don't give me the solution. I will paste in the code afterwards and you should let me know if I did it right.\n",
